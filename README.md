# Case Study: Dual-Narrative Synthesis with Generative AI

This repository contains the documentation for "Under One Roof," a research project designed to test an AI's ability to maintain two tonally opposite storylines—a wholesome office romance and a gritty delinquent drama—within a single, cohesive narrative.

The primary goal was to analyze how a Large Language Model (DeepSeek AI) handles the challenge of parallel storytelling, where the two plots intersect thematically and spatially but the characters of one plot remain largely unaware of the other. This project explores the AI's capacity for creating and managing dramatic irony, subtext, and character-driven secrets.

### Core Research Questions

* How effectively can an AI sustain two distinct genre tones (Slice-of-Life Romance vs. Shounen Action) in parallel chapters without tonal bleed?
* What level of prompting is required to create subtle, indirect connections between the two narratives while maintaining the central secret?
* Can the AI generate believable character dynamics and dramatic irony based on the premise of hidden lives coexisting under one roof?

### Skills Demonstrated

* **Parallel Narrative Construction:** Architecting two separate plots that progress simultaneously and intersect in meaningful ways.
* **AI Capability Analysis:** Documenting the AI's performance in managing secrets, subtext, and long-term narrative consistency.
* **Tonal Control & Genre Blending:** Mastering the balance between wholesome, comedic moments and gritty, action-oriented scenes.
* **Complex World-Building:** Developing a setting and social system that can believably support both storylines, as detailed in the [World-Building Document](Worldbuilding.pdf).
